# C̀

This repository is a monolithic workspace designed to contain multiple projects.


## Build & Run

To build a project:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build outputs a single HTML file with all scripts and styles inlined.

The final result is a self-contained HTML file, using [Vite's Singlefile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-singlefile) plugin.
